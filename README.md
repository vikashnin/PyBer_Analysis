# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this challenge I had to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. With the data I had to create various charts that would show the result of average fare, total number of rides, and drivers for each city type(Rural, Suburban, Urban).

## Results

### PyBer Summary

Urban cities have the highest number of drivers and total number of rides taken with the lowest fare fee compared to the Rural city. What I found interesting was that the urban cities had 2,405 drivers and 1,625 number of rides why is why they have such a low fare fee since there is more competition. 

### Total Fare by City

It is important to note that during late February rural, urban, and suburban cities all saw a spike in the total fares. Urban cities also had multiple spikes during the month of March. While in suburban and rural cities during the month of March stayed pretty consistent.

## Summary 
1. I would recommend more advertisement in urban cites, in order to get more users to avoid losing drivers(since right we have also double the drivers vs rides taken). If there is less driver the wait time might be longer cause the users to become less patient.  
2. I would also investigate the drop in late March in urban cities. It is the highest drop since the beginning of the year. Since, that is around the same time as spring break I would expect it to be higher. 
3. I would recommend gather the data for the whole year. In order for us to get a better understanding. We will be able to analyze the different seasons, holidays, etc... and how it effects PyBer.
