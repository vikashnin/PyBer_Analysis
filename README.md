## Overview of the Analysis
In this challenge I had to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. With the data I had to create various charts that would show the result of average fare, total number of rides, and drivers for each city type(Rural, Suburban, Urban).
